##UgandaLegalAI

UgandaLegalAI is a modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG 3.0) system built to improve access to Ugandan law.

The system ingests official legislation PDFs, builds a persistent FAISS vector index, applies cross-encoder reranking for precision retrieval, and uses Groq-powered large language models to generate grounded, detailed, and context-aware responses.

Designed for community legal awareness, NGOs, and civic-tech deployment, the system emphasizes:

Grounded answers using official Acts

Low hallucination risk through strict context control

Fast inference via Groq

Persistent vector indexing (no re-embedding required)

Modern, responsive chatbot UI built with Streamlit

This project demonstrates how advanced RAG architectures can be used for legal access and public empowerment in emerging markets.
